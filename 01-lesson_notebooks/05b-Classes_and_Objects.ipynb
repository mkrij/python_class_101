    "The `class` keyword is used to define a class. The name of a class should start with a capital letter. Classes should have a docstring that describes their purpose and any additional information someone might need to know when using the class. Functions that are part of a class are often referred to as **methods**. This `Pet` class only has a single method with the special name `__init__` (two underscores on either side). This method creates a `Pet` with whatever species and name you passed to that method. The species and name are the **data members** (or fields or attributes) of the `Pet` class. The special parameter `self` refers to the object itself. You don't call the `__init__` method by name - instead you use the name of the class. You also don't pass an argument for `self` - that's done automatically for you. Confused? Some examples should help. Let's create a couple of Pets:\n",

    "Each of these lines creates a new `Pet` **object**. The `Pet` class is just a general blueprint for Pets. To create a specific `Pet` object, we use the name of the class as shown above. This automatically calls the `__init__` method. An object is sometimes referred to as an \"instance\" of a class, and creating an object as \"instantiating\" a class. Once we've created an object, we can access its attributes using dot notation:\n",

    "If we want for other code to be able to access a private data member, we need to provide get and/or set methods. A get method just returns the current value of the corresponding data member. A set method takes a parameter and just sets the corresponding data member to the value of the parameter. The normal naming convention is `get_` or `set_` followed by the name of the corresponding data member. For the account ID we provided both get and set methods. For the balance, we only provided a `get` method, since the balance is changed via the deposit and withdraw methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might wonder why we would want to have private data members if it means writing more methods. The reason is that it allows us to control access to the data members. If we don't want a data member to be accessed, we can just not write get and/or set methods for it. Or if a data member should only be set to a certain range of values, then we can check for that in the set method. If a data member is public, then it can be changed to anything from anywhere, which can make your program logic harder to understand and debug. Controlling access to data members this way is referred to as **information hiding** (or data hiding).\n",
    "\n",
    "Information hiding is important because it allows you to control how certain parts of the class are accessed.  It allows you to separate interface (the names and expected parameters of any public functions) from implementation (the definitions of those functions, and also any private data members or private functions).  Making that distinction makes it easier to modify the class later on.  If you allow the user to directly access any part of the class, then some users' code will end up depending on specific details of the implementation, which means that if you change the implementation later, you'll break any code that depends on it.  It makes code much more modular if you provide a defined interface.  The specific implementation details can then be allowed to change as long as the interface remains the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to private data members, we can also indicate that methods are private in the same way. The reason we would make a method private is if it's just meant for internal use by the class and not part of the way we expect users to interact with the class. An example of this would be if we had a `Fraction` class and we wanted the Fractions to always be in reduced form. To accomplish this, we could have a `greatest_common_divisor()` function that can be used within the class. However, we wouldn't normally expect users to interact with a `Fraction` object by asking it to find the gcd of two integers - we expect them to do more explicitly Fraction-y things, like printing the `Fraction` or multiplying it by another `Fraction`. Finding the gcd of two integers is an implementation detail that can be \"hidden\" from the users."
